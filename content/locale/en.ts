During this time we hope you will join us in listening, learning and celebrating the accomplishments and work being done to address data sovereignty issues Native people and communities face within technology. We look forward to the speakers inspiring innovation and sparking conversations so together we can continue to craft technology that truly serves Native communities and respects Native identities.",
